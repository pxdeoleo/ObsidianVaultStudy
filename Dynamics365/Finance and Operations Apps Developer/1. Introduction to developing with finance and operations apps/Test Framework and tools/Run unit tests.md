>Running unit tests in large development projects is crucial for verifying code functionality before deployment, ensuring robustness and minimizing bugs in production.

#### Definitions
- Unit Tests: Isolated tests that verify the functionality of a specific section of code, typically a method, within a larger application.

>[!info] Unit Test Structure

Unit tests in Visual Studio must adhere to specific conventions, including extending the `SysTestCase` class and using the `SysTestMethod` decorator for test methods.

>[!bug] Common Testing Mistakes

Avoid using parameters in test methods or expecting them to return values, as this contradicts the framework's requirements for unit tests.

>[!info] Testing Methods

Unit tests often comprise three stages:
- **Arrange**: Set up the initial conditions and inputs.
- **Act**: Execute the function or method under test.
- **Assert**: Verify that the outcome matches the expected results.

>[!tip] Efficient Test Setup

Utilize the `setup()` method to initialize common variables or configurations needed across multiple test methods, improving test maintainability and readability.

>[!attention] Asserting Correctness

Choose the appropriate assert method, like `AssertEquals()`, `assertTrue()`, or `assertNotNull()`, to validate outcomes accurately. Use `this.parmExceptionExpected(true)` to verify that exceptions are thrown as expected.

>[!example] Creating and Running a Test Case

1. Create a test class extending `SysTestCase`.
2. Implement test methods with no parameters and void return type, decorated with `SysTestMethod`.
3. Organize test logic into arrange, act, and assert sections.
4. Use the `setup()` method for shared variables.
5. Right-click the test class and select "Run tests" to execute.
6. Observe results and make necessary adjustments based on failed tests.

>[!info] Continuous Development and Testing

Regularly updating and running unit tests as new functionalities are added ensures ongoing compliance with project requirements and early detection of issues, streamlining the development process.
