>Visual Studio's SysTest Framework enables developers to write, integrate, and automate unit tests for application functionality, enhancing code reliability and efficiency.

#### Definitions
- SysTest Framework: A testing framework in Visual Studio for creating and running automated unit tests on [[Dynamics 365 applications]].

>[!info] Test Integration and Automation

The SysTest Framework allows for seamless integration of unit tests into the development cycle, ensuring all functionality is verified during builds.

>[!bug] Accurate Test Setup

Ensure the test environment is properly configured and test data is reset before each test to maintain the integrity of test results.

>[!info] Utilizing [[Task Recorder]]

[[Task Recorder]] recordings can be imported into Visual Studio to generate automated test code, simplifying the creation of test cases.

>[!tip] Continuous Validation

Regularly running tests after code modifications helps quickly verify that changes have not adversely affected existing functionalities.

>[!attention] Efficient Regression Testing

Utilize automated tests during software upgrades to efficiently validate functionality without extensive manual user testing.

>[!example] Creating and Running a Test Case

1. Open Visual Studio and load the FleetManagement solution.
2. Add a new project named FleetManagementUnitTestSample.
3. Create a test class and define test methods using X++.
4. Build the project and run all tests through Test Explorer to verify code functionality.

>[!info] Test Module Management

Creating a test module helps organize and manage test codes, making them easily identifiable and executable during the build process.

#### Step-by-Step Guide for Creating a Test Module
- Open Dynamics 365 in Visual Studio.
- Navigate to Model Management and create a new model with "test" in its name.
- Include references to essential Dynamics 365 models and form adaptors.
- Complete the model creation to integrate it into your development and testing workflow.
