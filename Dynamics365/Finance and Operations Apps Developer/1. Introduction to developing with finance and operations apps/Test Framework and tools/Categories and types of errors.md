>Understanding various categories and types of errors in software development is crucial for implementing robust error handling and exception management strategies.

#### Definitions
- Exception: A disruption in the normal flow of a program's execution, typically handled through specific programming constructs like `try...catch`.

>[!info] Error Handling Techniques

Error handling in programming involves using `throw`, `try...catch`, `finally`, and `retry` statements to manage exceptions effectively and maintain program stability.

>[!bug] Common Error Handling Mistakes

Improper use of `retry` within `catch` blocks or incorrect exception categorization can lead to infinite loops or unhandled exceptions, compromising application reliability.

>[!info] Exception Handling Keywords

- **Throw**: Used to explicitly raise an exception.
- **Try...Catch**: Encapsulates code that may throw an exception and handles it.
- **Finally**: Guarantees code execution after `try...catch`, regardless of an exception being thrown.
- **Retry**: Re-attempts the execution of code in the `try` block under certain conditions.

>[!tip] Recommended Practices

Prefer using `Global::error` over `Exception::error` for better integration with system logging and user feedback through the Infolog.

>[!attention] Handling Specific Exceptions

Developers should design their catch blocks to handle both specific and generic exceptions to ensure all possible error scenarios are covered.

>[!example] Example of Structured Exception Handling

```x++
try
{
  // Potentially problematic code here.
}
catch (Exception::Numeric)
{
  info("Caught a Numeric exception.");
}
catch
{
  info("Caught an unspecified exception.");
}
finally
{
  // Code that executes after try/catch, regardless of outcome.
}
```

>[!info] Types of Exceptions

Several specific exceptions can be thrown in different scenarios:
- **Break**: User interruption.
- **CLRError**: CLR integration issues.
- **CodeAccessSecurity**: Security permission issues.
- **Deadlock**: Concurrency issues within database transactions.
- **DuplicateKeyException**: Optimistic concurrency conflicts.
- **Error**: General fatal errors stopping transactions.
- **Internal**: Errors within the development system.
- **Numeric**: Conversion errors from strings to numbers.
- **UpdateConflict**: Issues during data update operations.

Understanding these exceptions is essential for creating resilient applications that handle errors gracefully and maintain consistent performance and reliability.
