The division of the application stack for finance and operations apps allows you to develop and customize the application by using the base foundation models. The model-based development also drives how to develop for finance and operations apps by using extensions, a less intrusive approach to development compared to over layering.

To further understand this concept, consider the three key models in finance and operations apps:

- **Application suite** - This is the largest out-of-the-box model. This model includes much of the metadata in the main navigational areas of the application, including modules such as Accounts receivable, Accounts payable, and Warehouse management.
- **Application foundation** - This includes metadata that comprises organizational modeling, number sequences in the system, global address book, and source documentation.
- **Application platform** - This contains runtime and data access metadata, workflow and services, the Dynamics 365 client and presentation, and SSRS reporting.

You can deploy [[Finance and operations apps in the cloud]], or [[Finance + Operations (on-premises)]]. As a developer, it's important for you to understand the difference between these architectures. Depending on the type of deployment that your organization chooses, architecture and the application capabilities might vary.
