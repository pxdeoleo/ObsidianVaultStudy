An AOT package is a deployment and compilation unit of one or more models that can be applied to a finance and operations apps environment. A deployable package can consist of several models that contain the metadata, binaries, reports, and other resources. The deployable package is used for deployment of code and customizations to the sandbox, test, and production environments for the application.

Process:
Develop -> Get latest -> Build -> Check in code -> Create a deployable package -> Apply to environment

Deployable packages are created in Visual Studio and then deployed to sandbox, test, and production environments by using [[Lifecycle Services]].

When finishing your code and customizations in Visual Studio, you must make a few considerations. If several developers are on one project, you should perform a **Get Latest** process to merge all new code that has been checked in by the other developers, and then perform a local build to ensure that your code will not disturb what is in the Azure DevOps repository.

### Create a deployment package in VS
- In Visual Studio, select **Extensions > Dynamics 365**.
- Select **Deploy > Create Deployment Package**.
- In the **Create Deployment Package** dialog, select the packages that contain the models that you want to deploy.
- You can select the **Referenced packages** drop-down arrow to view all the dependent models of the models that are selected.
- In the **Package file location** field, you can select the ellipsis 'â€¦' to select where you want to save the package file.
- When you have selected all the models for the deployable package, select **Create**. A zip file will be saved to the location that you specified.
## Production deployment

To deploy to production, customers can schedule a downtime that will determine when an update will be applied to the production environment by Microsoft. To schedule downtime to apply updates to the environment, the package must have been applied to at least one sandbox environment in the same project. You can submit a service request for this in [[Lifecycle Services]].
