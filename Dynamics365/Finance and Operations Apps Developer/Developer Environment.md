Visual Studio is the integrated development environment (IDE) that is used for all finance and operations apps development. As a developer, you will work in your own development environment with access to Visual Studio, which enables you to access all the developer tools and components, including source control by using Azure DevOps. Because multiple developers are generally developing for the application at a single time, Azure DevOps is required for source control.
At a high level, it's important to understand that you will use Visual Studio to develop for finance and operations apps, manage code on your team with source control by using Azure DevOps, perform builds and testing, and create deployable packages.
