>Understanding table methods in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations apps is crucial for developers to effectively manage data interactions and validations in custom tables. These methods allow for sophisticated data handling during record creation, modification, validation, and deletion.

#### Definitions
- **Table Methods**: Functions defined in a table class that execute specific operations when records are created, modified, inserted, or validated.

>[!info] Key Table Methods

Several standard methods are essential for handling table records:
- **initValue()**: Initializes field values when a new record is created.
- **find()**: Retrieves a specific record based on a key.
- **insert()**: Executes operations when a new record is inserted.
- **modifiedField()**: Responds to changes in field values.
- **validateField()**: Ensures data in a field meets specific criteria.
- **validateWrite()**: Validates conditions before saving a record.

>[!bug] Common Method Misuse

Misconfigurations or inappropriate use of these methods can lead to data integrity issues or performance inefficiencies.

>[!info] Custom Methods and Extensions

- **Custom Methods**: Developer-defined functions that cater to specific business logic not covered by standard methods.
- **Extensions**: Modifications added to existing table methods using the chain of command to introduce additional functionality without altering the base code.

>[!tip] Best Practices for Method Implementation

Ensure that all table methods include appropriate super() calls to execute inherited framework logic, and use delegates when injecting custom logic into standard methods.

>[!attention] Chain of Command and Delegates

Utilize the chain of command for extending functionality and delegates for inserting code into existing methods, enhancing flexibility while maintaining upgradability.

>[!example] Implementing Table Methods

1. **Using initValue()**:
   ```X++
   public void initValue()
   {
       super();
       this.TrainingType = TrainingType::Online;
   }
   ```
2. **Creating a find() Method**:
   ```X++
   static TrainingParameters find(boolean _forupdate = false)
   {
       TrainingParameters parameter;
       select firstonly parameter where parameter.Key == 0;
       return parameter;
   }
   ```
3. **Handling validateWrite()**:
   ```X++
   public boolean validateWrite()
   {
       boolean ret = super();
       if (!TrainerTable::find(this.TrainerID).Rate)
       {
           ret = checkFailed("Please enter Trainer's rate");
       }
       return ret;
   }
   ```

Proper implementation of table methods ensures robust data handling, accurate validations, and seamless integration with UI forms, significantly improving the user experience and system reliability.
