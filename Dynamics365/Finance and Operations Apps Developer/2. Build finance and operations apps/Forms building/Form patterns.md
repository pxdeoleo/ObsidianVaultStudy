>[!summary]
>Form patterns in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations apps are standardized templates that guide the design and functionality of user interfaces, ensuring consistency, usability, and responsiveness across the application.

#### Definitions
- **Form Patterns**: Predefined templates used in form development to ensure standardization in the user interface layout and behavior.

>[!info] Importance of Using Form Patterns

Using form patterns is highly recommended as they:
- Provide a consistent and familiar user experience.
- Ensure forms adhere to best practices in layout and navigation.
- Simplify the development process by offering a structured approach.
- Enhance compatibility with updates and modifications.

>[!bug] Common Issues Without Patterns

Forms developed without adhering to patterns might face issues with:
- Inconsistency in user interface leading to a confusing user experience.
- Compatibility problems with future updates or patches.
- Non-responsive designs that do not adapt well to different screen sizes.

>[!info] Types of Form Patterns

Commonly used form patterns include:
- **Simple List**: Ideal for entities with up to six fields without parent/child relationships.
- **Simple List and Details**: Suitable for entities with more than six fields.
- **Master Details**: Facilitates detailed data entry with expandable FastTabs.
- **Details Transaction**: Displays data in a header and line view format.
- **List Page**: Optimizes data browsing and actions on records.
- **Workspace**: Organizes significant business activities in one place.
- **Wizard**: Guides users through sequential tasks.

>[!tip] Best Practices for Applying Form Patterns

- **Start with a Pattern**: Always start form design with an appropriate pattern to guide structure and functionality.
- **Understand Subpatterns**: Utilize subpatterns for specific areas like FastTabs to maintain consistency within sections of a form.
- **Preview and Validate**: Regularly use the pattern pane to preview and validate the form against the selected pattern during development.

>[!attention] Migration from Legacy Systems

For forms originally designed in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 or earlier, ensure that they are updated or migrated to supported patterns in Dynamics 365, following the provided migration paths to modern patterns.

>[!example] Applying a Form Pattern in Visual Studio

To apply a form pattern in Visual Studio:
1. Add a new form to your project via Solution Explorer.
2. Use the Form Designer window to structure the form according to the selected pattern.
3. Utilize the left pane for methods and data sources, the right pane for applying patterns, and the bottom pane for guided pattern completion.
4. Ensure all required elements by the pattern are included; otherwise, the build process will highlight errors.

>[!info] Enhancing Form Development

Form patterns not only streamline the development process but also ensure that every form within the application delivers a reliable and user-friendly experience. By adhering to these patterns, developers can significantly reduce errors and enhance the maintainability of the application.
