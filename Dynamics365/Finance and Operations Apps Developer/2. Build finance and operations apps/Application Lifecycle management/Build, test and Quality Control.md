>Effective management of build, testing, and quality control processes is crucial in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations to ensure that development aligns with business requirements and maintains high quality standards.

#### Build Management
- **Project Plan for Builds**: Organize when and where builds occur, ensuring code moves sequentially from Development to Testing and then to Production, incorporating rollbacks for failed tests.
- **Environment Selection**: Strategically select environments based on their intended use (development, testing, UAT, production) and tier (Tier-1 for development, Tier-2 for UAT and performance testing).

>[!info] Environment Planning
- Understand and plan the purpose, topology, and tier of each environment.
- Utilize Lifecycle Services for environment management.
- Consider additional environments or cloud-hosted options as necessary.

#### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Focuses on individual functions or pieces of code.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensures new code does not adversely affect existing functionality.
- **Performance Testing**: Tests the stability and performance under load.

>[!tip] Using Tools for Testing
- **Task Recorder**: Document and automate user actions for testing.
- **Azure DevOps**: Manage tasks linked to development solutions for better tracking and documentation.

#### Quality Control
- **Source Control**: Use Azure DevOps for source control to manage access to codebase, ensuring developers do not overwrite each other's work.
- **Version Control**: Maintain historical versions of code for accountability and rollback capabilities.
- **Best Practices**: Adhere to and develop organizational best practices for coding and naming conventions.

>[!bug] Common Pitfalls
- Underestimating the importance of a detailed project plan for builds can lead to disorganized deployment and potential system downtime.
- Neglecting thorough testing can result in unstable releases and increased post-deployment issues.

#### Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Create a Detailed Build Schedule**:
   - Define times and order of builds.
   - Plan for environment migrations and necessary rollbacks.

2. **Decide on Necessary Environments**:
   - Clearly define the role of each environment.
   - Schedule their setup and availability according to project phases.

3. **Develop a Comprehensive Testing Plan**:
   - Define who will perform the testing and the criteria for passing.
   - Plan for different types of tests based on project requirements.

4. **Set Up Source and Version Control**:
   - Implement a robust system for managing code changes.
   - Regularly synchronize code to ensure all developers are working with the most recent versions.

5. **Establish and Enforce Quality Standards**:
   - Regularly review and update coding best practices.
   - Conduct periodic code reviews and quality audits.
