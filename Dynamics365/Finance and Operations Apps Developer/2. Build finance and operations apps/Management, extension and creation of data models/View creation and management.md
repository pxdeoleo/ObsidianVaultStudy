>Views in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations apps provide structured access to data by combining fields from multiple tables, supporting efficient data retrieval and display in user interfaces.

#### Definitions
- **View**: A virtual table in Dynamics 365 that organizes data from one or more underlying tables or views for specific querying and reporting purposes.

>[!info] Components of Views

Views consist of several key components similar to tables:
- **Fields**: Columns in the view that can be direct or computed from underlying tables.
- **Field Groups**: Logical groupings of fields used in forms and reports.
- **Indexes**: Optional structures to enhance data retrieval efficiency.
- **Relations**: Define relationships with other views or tables.
- **State Machines**: Not typically used in views but available for advanced configurations.
- **Mappings**: Associate fields in the view with fields in other objects.
- **Methods**: Support calculated fields or display methods.
- **Events**: Used to trigger actions based on data changes, although typically less common in views.

>[!bug] Common Pitfalls in View Creation

Improper setup of computed columns or incorrect method implementations can lead to performance issues or runtime errors during data retrieval.

>[!info] Creating and Managing Views

To create a view:
1. Navigate to the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click your project, select Add > New item, and choose View.
3. Use the Designer window to configure the view's properties and add fields, either directly or as computed columns.

>[!tip] Best Practices for Computed Columns

Computed columns should be defined carefully to ensure they do not adversely impact view performance. Use efficient T-SQL operations and validate all expressions for correctness.

>[!attention] Extending Views

While direct code extensions are not possible for views, you can extend view functionality using view extensions and event handlers:
- **View Extensions**: Add fields, change metadata, or adjust field groups.
- **Event Handlers**: Implement pre-events and post-events for methods.

>[!example] Example of Creating a Computed Column

To create a computed column in a view, define a method in X++ that returns a T-SQL expression. For example, to compute a negative amount:
```X++
public static str negativeAmountMST()
{
    #define.ViewName(AssetTransReverse)
    #define.DataSourceName("AssetTrans_1")
    #define.AmountMSTField("AmountMST")

    DictView dictView = new DictView(tableNum(#ViewName));
    str amountMST = dictView.computedColumnString(#DataSourceName, #AmountMSTField, FieldNameGenerationMode::FieldList, true);

    return SysComputedColumn::negative(amountMST);
}
```
This method generates a SQL statement that is used to define the computed column in the view, which dynamically calculates the negative of the `AmountMST` field.

>[!info] Synchronizing and Extending Views

Ensure that views are synchronized with the database after modifications to reflect changes and avoid errors. Use extensions to adapt views to evolving business requirements without modifying the original view definitions directly, maintaining clean and upgradeable code.
