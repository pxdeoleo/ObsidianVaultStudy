>Table maps in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations serve as an abstraction layer to manage commonalities between different record types, enhancing data integrity and simplifying business logic implementation.

#### Definitions
- **Table Map**: A framework element that defines a common set of fields and methods applicable to multiple tables, facilitating consistent data handling across various tables that share similar structures.

>[!info] Purpose of Table Maps

Table maps are used to capture similarities between different table types, ensuring that operations such as data validation, retrieval, and manipulation are consistent and maintain integrity across the application.

>[!bug] Limitations in Extending Table Maps

Unlike tables and classes, table maps cannot be extended directly using extensions. Any modifications or enhancements must be handled through mappings or interface classes.

>[!info] Creating and Managing Table Maps

To create a table map:
1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your project and select Add > New Item > Data Model > Map.
2. Use the Table Map Designer in Visual Studio to configure fields, field groups, mappings, and methods.

>[!tip] Best Practices for Using Table Maps

- Utilize interface classes to implement table-specific logic when direct extensions are not possible.
- Employ mappings to associate specific fields between tables within the map to ensure data consistency and enforce business rules.

>[!attention] Mapping and Interface Implementation

Interface classes provide a structured way to implement custom logic for mapped tables, allowing for reusable and maintainable code. Hereâ€™s how to set up an interface class for a table map:

1. **Create an Interface Class**: Define an abstract class that includes methods for operations you need to perform across mapped tables.
2. **Implement the Interface**: For each table that requires specific behavior, create a class that extends this interface.

>[!example] Example of Interface Class Usage

```X++
public abstract class MyCustVendMapInterface
{
   protected MyCustVendMap myCustVendMap;
   private MyCustVendMapInterface origInstance;

   protected void new() {}

   protected void initializeMyCustVendMap(MyCustVendMap _myCustVendMap = myCustVendMap)
   {
       myCustVendMap = _myCustVendMap;
   }

   public final MyCustVendMap getMyCustVendMap()
   {
       return myCustVendMap;
   }

   public static MyCustVendMapInterface createInstance(MyCustVendMap _myCustVendMap)
   {
       // Factory method implementation
   }
}
```

>[!info] Using Mappings in Table Maps

Mappings are crucial in defining how data from one table relates to another within the map. They are set up directly in the table map designer under the Mappings node.

#### Extending Table Maps

While direct extensions are not possible, mappings and interface classes can be used to modify the behavior of table maps:

- **Mappings**: Customize how fields from different tables correlate within the map.
- **Interface Classes**: Add business logic that cannot be directly implemented in the map.

Ensure that your mapping and interface implementations align with business requirements to fully leverage the power of table maps in simplifying and standardizing data operations across your application.
