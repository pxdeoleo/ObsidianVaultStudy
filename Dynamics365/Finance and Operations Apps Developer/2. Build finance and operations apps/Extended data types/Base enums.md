>Base enums in Visual Studio are essential elements in X++ programming for Dynamics 365, used to represent a list of literals as integers for efficient storage and display in the user interface.
#### Definitions
- Base Enum: A static list in X++ where each literal is represented by an integer, used to store options or states in a compact form.

>[!info] Creation of Base Enums

To create a base enum, you must define it in Visual Studio before using it in your X++ code. This ensures that all necessary properties and literals are properly set up and integrated into your project.

>[!bug] Integer Representation

While enums simplify coding by using descriptive names, they are stored in the database as integers. This can lead to confusion if not properly documented or understood by developers.

>[!info] Enum Usage in User Interface

Enums are automatically translated from their integer values to descriptive labels in the user interface, making them user-friendly without additional coding for forms.

>[!tip] Effective Enum Management

When creating enums, assign meaningful names and labels to each literal to ensure they are intuitive for both developers and end-users.

>[!attention] Enum Properties Customization

Utilize the Properties window to adjust characteristics like display length, style, and behavior to match the specific requirements of your finance and operations apps.

>[!example] Practical Enum Example

Consider the `NoYes` enum:
- **Literals**: `No` (value 0), `Yes` (value 1)
- **Usage**: Often used as a simple Boolean in forms, representing options like active/inactive.

>[!info] Enum Display Options

Base enums can appear as drop-down menus or as buttons in the UI, with each selection triggering interface updates based on the selected enum value.

#### Customizing Enums
- **Add Enums to Project**: In Solution Explorer, right-click the project, select Add > New Item, and choose Base Enum.
- **Define Literals and Properties**: Assign integers to literals and use the Properties window to set the Label for user-friendly display.
- **Use in X++**: Reference enum values in code by their literal names, simplifying code readability and maintenance.

This approach to using base enums not only optimizes data storage but also enhances the user experience by providing clear, understandable options in application interfaces.
