>Learn how to seamlessly integrate .NET libraries with X++ code in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations apps using Visual Studio, enabling the use of robust .NET functionalities directly within your X++ projects.

#### Definitions
- **.NET Libraries**: Precompiled code libraries developed in .NET languages such as C# that can be used to extend the functionality of X++ applications.

>[!info] Steps to Integrate .NET Libraries
1. **Build the C# Project**: Ensure that the C# project or class library you wish to reference is compiled before it is referenced by your X++ project.
2. **Create Projects**: Add both a C# class library project and a Dynamics 365 Finance Operations project to your solution in Visual Studio.
3. **Add References**: Right-click the References folder in your Finance Operations project and choose 'Add Reference' to link the C# project or desired .NET assembly.

>[!bug] Common Integration Issues
- Failure to build the C# project before adding references can lead to compilation errors in the X++ project.

>[!tip] Best Practices for .NET Integration
- Always keep the .NET assemblies updated and aligned with the latest changes in your X++ project to avoid runtime issues.
- Regularly verify that all references are correctly deployed to the cloud during project deployment.

>[!example] Example of Adding a .NET Reference
- **Adding a Reference**:
  ```plaintext
  // Navigate to the References folder in the Solution Explorer of your Finance Operations project.
  // Right-click and select 'Add Reference'.
  // Choose the appropriate .dll file or project reference to add.
  ```

>[!attention] Deployment Considerations
- Ensure that .NET assemblies referenced in your project are included in the deployment package to prevent failures in cloud environments.
