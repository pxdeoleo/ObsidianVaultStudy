> [!summary] Understanding different data types and operators in X++ is essential for effective programming in Dynamics 365. This note covers primitive and composite data types as well as basic operators used in X++.

#### Definitions

- **Data Types**: Categories of data that can be used in programming to define the type and nature of data that can be processed.
- **Operators**: Symbols that tell the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations.

> [!info] Primitive Data Types

- **Boolean, Date, Enum, GUID, Int, Int64, Real, Str, TimeOfDay, UtcDateTime**: Basic types that form the foundation of data manipulation in X++.

> [!info] Composite Data Types

- **Arrays, Containers, Classes, Delegates, Tables**: More complex structures that allow for sophisticated data management and operations in X++.

> [!tip] Effective Use of Data Types

- Utilize specific data types like `UtcDateTime` over `Date` for better precision and timezone management.
- Enums are particularly useful for creating readable and maintainable code with predefined options.

> [!example] Operators in X++

- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc., manage the assignment and modification of values.
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, manage mathematical operations among variables.
- **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc., compare values and determine logical flow.
