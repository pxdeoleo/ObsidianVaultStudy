>Understanding and implementing conditional and iterative statements in X++ is crucial for effective control flow and repeated operations in application logic.

#### Definitions
- **Conditional Statements**: Code constructs that execute actions based on whether a condition is true or false.
- **Iterative Statements (Loops)**: Structures that repeat a block of code multiple times until a condition changes.

>[!info] Types of Conditional Statements
- **If Statements**: Execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **If...Else Statements**: Provide an alternative set of statements if the condition is false.
- **Switch Statements**: Allow multi-way branching using case statements.

>[!bug] Common Mistakes
- Failing to include `break` in switch cases can lead to unintentional "fall-through", where multiple cases are executed.

>[!info] Types of Iterative Statements
- **While Loops**: Execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
- **Do...While Loops**: Similar to while loops but guarantee the loop is executed at least once.
- **For Loops**: Efficiently iterate over a range or collection with initialization, condition, and increment in one line.

>[!tip] Effective Use of Loops
- Utilize `break` to exit a loop early under specific conditions.
- Use `continue` to skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and proceed with the next iteration.

>[!example] Implementing Loops and Conditional Logic
- **If...Else Example**:
  ```x++
  if (x == 5)
  {
      info('x equals five');
  }
  else
  {
      info('x does not equal five');
  }
  ```
- **For Loop Example**:
  ```x++
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
  {
      print array[i];
  }
  ```

>[!attention] Combining Conditions
- Use logical operators like `&&` (and) and `||` (or) to combine multiple conditions within your conditional statements.

By mastering these structured programming constructs, developers can effectively manage and utilize data within their Dynamics 365 applications, leading to robust and maintainable code.
