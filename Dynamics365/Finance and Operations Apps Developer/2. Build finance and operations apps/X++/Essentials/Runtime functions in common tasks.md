>[!summary]
>X++ includes a variety of built-in runtime functions that facilitate common programming tasks, ranging from business calculations to string manipulations, enhancing both development efficiency and code effectiveness.

#### Definitions
- **Runtime Functions**: Predefined methods in X++ designed to perform specific operations, reducing the need for custom code for common tasks.

>[!info] Categories of X++ Runtime Functions
1. **Business Operations**: Functions related to financial transactions and formulas.
2. **Container Operations**: Manipulate and manage the container data types.
3. **Conversions**: Convert data from one type to another.
4. **Date Operations**: Perform operations related to date data types.
5. **Mathematical Operations**: Execute mathematical calculations.
6. **Reflection Operations**: Inspect and modify metadata of objects.
7. **Session Operations**: Manage user sessions and interactions with Dynamics 365.
8. **String Operations**: Modify and manipulate strings.

>[!tip] Effective Use of Runtime Functions
- Leverage these functions to simplify code, enhance readability, and ensure reliable operation by reducing the need for error-prone custom implementations.

>[!example] Examples of Runtime Function Usage
- **Date Operations**:
  ```x++
  // Add 10 days to the current date
  info(strFmt("Date in 10 days: %1", dateAdd(systemDateGet(), 10, DateDay)));
  ```
- **String Operations**:
  ```x++
  // Concatenate two strings
  str myString = strFmt("%1 %2", "Hello", "World!");
  info(myString);
  ```
- **Mathematical Operations**:
  ```x++
  // Calculate the square root of a number
  real sqrtValue = sqrt(16);
  info(strFmt("Square root: %1", sqrtValue));
  ```

>[!attention] Avoiding Common Mistakes
- Ensure correct data types are used with runtime functions to prevent runtime errors.
- Use appropriate error handling when dealing with functions that may throw exceptions (e.g., division by zero in mathematical operations).
