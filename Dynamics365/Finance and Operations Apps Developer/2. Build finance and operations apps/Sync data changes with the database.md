>Synchronizing the database in Dynamics 365 ensures that changes to the application's elements are correctly reflected in the database structure, preventing SQL errors and data inconsistencies.

#### Definitions
- **Database Synchronization**: The process of updating the database schema to match changes made in the application's elements and code, ensuring alignment between the application and its underlying data storage.

>[!info] Synchronization Process

To synchronize your database after adding or modifying elements, use the 'Synchronize Database' option from the Dynamics 365 menu in Visual Studio.

>[!bug] Potential Issues with Unsynchronized Databases

Failure to synchronize after changes can lead to SQL errors in finance and operations apps, as the database schema might not correctly represent the current state of application elements.

>[!info] Steps to Synchronize Database

1. From the Dynamics 365 menu, select 'Synchronize Database'.
2. In the dialog box, click the 'Synchronize' button to start the synchronization process.

>[!tip] Automating Synchronization

Enable the 'Synchronize Database on Build' option in the Build Models dialog box to automatically synchronize the database every time the project is successfully built, enhancing workflow efficiency.

>[!attention] Ensuring Data Integrity

Regularly synchronize the database, especially after significant changes or updates, to maintain data integrity and application stability.

>[!example] Manual vs. Automated Synchronization

- **Manual Synchronization**: Useful for single projects or when precise control over synchronization timing is needed.
- **Automated Synchronization on Build**: Best for development environments where changes are frequent and incremental, ensuring continuous alignment between the database and application code.

>[!info] Managing Database Synchronization

Understanding when and how to synchronize the database is crucial for developers working with Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps. Proper synchronization practices prevent runtime issues and support a stable development environment.
