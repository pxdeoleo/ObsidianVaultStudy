>Properly setting and managing properties of new elements like tables or fields in Visual Studio is crucial for effective database design and user interface representation in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations apps.

#### Definitions
- **Properties**: Configuration settings for tables, fields, and other elements within a project that dictate behavior, appearance, and relationships within the database and UI.

>[!info] Key Table Properties

Understanding and configuring table properties correctly is vital for optimizing database performance and UI integration:
- **Table Type**: Differentiates between regular and temporary tables (e.g., TempDB, InMemory).
- **Name**: Visible in UI forms and should follow camel case conventions.
- **Label**: Identifies the table in Visual Studio; should be set using a label file.
- **Primary Index**: Essential for database optimization, indicating the main index field.
- **Cluster Index**: Determines table organization in the database; should not be empty.
- **Configuration Key**: Enables system administrators to toggle application features.
- **Support Inheritance**: Indicates if the table can serve as a base for other tables.
- **Extends**: Specifies the parent table in case of inheritance.

>[!bug] Common Configuration Errors

Failing to set critical properties like the cluster index or incorrectly configuring inheritance properties can lead to performance issues and complications in table extension scenarios.

>[!info] Field and Base Enum Properties

Field properties are generally adjusted at the individual element level:
- **EDT Properties**: Vary by type (e.g., string, integer, date) and include settings like character limits or date formats.
- **Base Enum Properties**: Dictate how enums appear in the UI, such as in drop-down menus, option buttons, or sliders.

>[!tip] Best Practices for Property Settings

It's advisable to keep properties like format or length set to Auto, allowing the system to adjust dynamically to UI requirements and ensuring consistency across different user interfaces.

>[!attention] Importance of Proper Property Configuration

Setting properties not only affects how data is stored and retrieved but also how it is presented and interacted with by users, highlighting the need for meticulous property management.

>[!example] Configuring a New Table

1. **Create a New Table**: In Solution Explorer, right-click the project, select Add > New Item, then choose Table.
2. **Set Properties**:
   - In the Properties window, assign a meaningful Label and Name.
   - Configure the Primary and Cluster Indexes for performance.
   - Decide on the Table Type based on usage needs (regular vs. temporary).
3. **Define Inheritance**:
   - If applicable, set Support Inheritance to Yes and use the Extends property to specify the parent table.

>[!info] Enhancing Application Design

Proper configuration of table and field properties is crucial for ensuring that the Dynamics 365 application not only performs optimally but also provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface. This enhances overall user satisfaction and system efficiency.
