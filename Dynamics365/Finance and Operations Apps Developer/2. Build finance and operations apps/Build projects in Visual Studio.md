>Creating and building projects in Visual Studio involves setting up the project structure, defining dependencies, and compiling the project to generate metadata used by applications to run extensions.

#### Definitions
- Project: A collection of files and resources in Visual Studio that are managed and compiled together to build applications or extensions.

>[!info] Project Creation Process

Initiate a new project through the File menu or by using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + Shift + N) to open the New Project wizard, where you can name your project and assign it to a specific model.

>[!bug] Model Assignment Issues

Selecting the correct model during project setup is critical as changing the model later can be challenging and may lead to complications in managing project files.

>[!info] Setting Dependencies

During or after project creation, set dependencies correctly to ensure all necessary models are referenced, preventing build errors due to missing dependencies.

>[!tip] Efficient Build Practices

Utilize the Build or Rebuild options from the Solution Explorer or the Build menu for individual projects or solutions to ensure your code is up to date and free from compilation errors.

>[!attention] Model Building Options

For comprehensive builds, especially when working with multiple models in Dynamics 365, use the Build Models option from the Dynamics 365 menu to specify and build selected models.

>[!example] Steps to Create and Build a Project

1. **Create a New Project**:
   - Navigate to File > New > Project, or use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + N.
   - Enter a name for your project and select the appropriate model.
   - Optionally, set up initial dependencies.

2. **Build the Project**:
   - Right-click the project in Solution Explorer and select Build or Rebuild.
   - For multiple model builds, go to Dynamics 365 > Build Models, select the required models, and click Build.
