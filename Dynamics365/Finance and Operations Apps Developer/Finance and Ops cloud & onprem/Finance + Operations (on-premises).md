The application is deployed locally within the customer's data center, and the data center is managed by the customer. It's important to remember that because an on-premises deployment is locally deployed, system requirements, hardware sizing, and functionality of the application differs from cloud deployments.

When an on-premises deployment is selected, the application servers and the Microsoft 

SQL Server database are run in the customer's data center.
Lifecycle Services is used to manage the on-premises deployment.

To build and manage an enterprise-class, high-scale application, on-premises deployments use Microsoft Azure Server Service standalone clusters.

The **Service Fabric standalone clusters** can be installed on any machine that is running Windows Server. There are two types of clusters: one for sandboxes and one for production environments. Application Object Servers (AOS), Financial Reports Designer (formally named Management Reporter), and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) are roles that are deployed in both the production and sandbox clusters.

There are differences in features that are available for cloud and on-premises deployments.
