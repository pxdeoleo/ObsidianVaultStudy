Comonents:

- **Subscription** - A subscription to finance and operations apps gives you an online cloud environment.
- **Licenses** - Customers must purchase subscription licenses (SLs) for their organization or for their affiliates' employees and on-site agents, vendors, or contractors who directly or indirectly access finance and operations apps. finance and operations apps are licensed through **Volume Licensing** and the **Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)** program.
- **[[Microsoft Entra]] ID** - Microsoft Entra ID is the multi-tenant, cloud-based directory and identity management service from Microsoft that combines core directory services, application access management, and identity protection in a single solution. Finance and operations uses Microsoft Entra ID as the store for identity. 
  Access to Microsoft Entra ID is provided as part of a subscription to finance and operations apps.
- **Tenant** - In Microsoft Entra ID, a tenant represents an organization. This is a dedicated instance of the Microsoft Entra ID service that an organization receives and owns when it creates a relationship with Microsoft (for example, by signing up for a Microsoft cloud service such as Azure, Intune, or Microsoft 365). Every Microsoft Entra tenant is distinct and separate from other Microsoft Entra tenants.
- **[[Microsoft 365 Admin help center]]** - A subscription management portal that Microsoft 365 provides for administrators. It's used to provide management functions through Microsoft Entra ID and subscriptions. As part of these management functions, it provides information about service health.
- **[[Lifecycle Services]]** - Is a collaboration portal that provides an environment and a set of regularly updated services that can help you manage the application lifecycle of your finance and operations implementations.
- **Azure DevOps** - Used primarily for code version control and to deploy a build environment. Azure DevOps is also used to track support incidents, such as work items in Azure DevOps that are submitted to Microsoft through cloud-powered support, and to integrate the [[Business Process Modeler (BPM) ]]library hierarchy into your Azure DevOps project as a hierarchy of work items. Azure DevOps is also used during code upgrades.

Finance and operations apps use many features of the Azure platform, such as Azure Storage, networking, monitoring, and Azure SQL Database
