> [!summary] 
> Testing the functionality of Dynamics 365 [[Business Central]] applications to ensure proper operation before release. Emphasis on repeatable and automated tests, leveraging built-in testing features and best practices.

#### Definitions

- **Test Codeunits and Test Methods**: Units and methods used to define and execute tests.
- **Test Runner Codeunits**: Codeunits that run test methods.
- **Test Pages**: Pages used for testing purposes.
- **UI Handlers**: Handlers for user interface testing.
- **ASSERTERROR Keyword**: Used to handle and validate expected errors in tests.

> [!info] Key Testing Features

- **Test Codeunits and Methods**: Define tests for business logic.
- **Test Runner Codeunits**: Execute multiple tests.
- **Test Pages**: Simulate UI interactions.
- **UI Handlers**: Manage UI elements during tests.
- **ASSERTERROR Keyword**: Validate that specific errors occur.

> [!info] Testing Best Practices

1. **Separate Test Code**: Keep test code separate from production code.
2. **Positive and Negative Tests**: Ensure code works in both successful and failing conditions.
3. **Automated Tests**: Tests should not require user intervention.
4. **Consistent System State**: Tests should start and end with the system in a known state.
5. **Fast Execution and Reporting**: Integrate tests with the test management system for quick execution and reporting.
6. **Structured Test Methods**:
    - Initialize and set up test conditions.
    - Invoke the business logic.
    - Validate expected results.
7. **Use Random Data**: Avoid hardcoded values; use random data where possible.

#### Example: Testing Purchase Invoice Discounts

> [!example] Test Scenario

Testing a modified codeunit (Purch-Calc.Discount) to ensure it calculates purchase invoice discounts correctly.

**Requirements**:

- Dynamics 365 Business Central with a developer license.
- CRONUS International Ltd. demo data company.
- Imported Test Toolkit.

**Steps**:

1. **Create Test Codeunit and Method**:
    
    - Define a new test codeunit for the Purch-Calc.Discount functionality.
    - Name test methods using the pattern: functionality, parameters, expected results.
2. **Define Test Scenario**:
    
    - **SCENARIO**: Validate discount calculation for purchase invoices.
    - **GIVEN**: Vendor with specific discount percentage and minimum amount.
    - **WHEN**: Calculate discount for a purchase invoice above the minimum amount.
    - **THEN**: Verify discount calculation matches expectations.
3. **Create Helper Method**:
    
    - Generate test data (vendor, purchase document, discount).
    - Reuse helper methods for similar tests.
