>Creating robust installation and upgrade code for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central extensions is crucial for managing the lifecycle of apps effectively. This guide explains how to write and manage install and upgrade code units, ensuring compatibility and functionality across Business Central updates.

#### Definitions
- **Install Codeunit**: A special type of codeunit used for executing code when an extension is installed or re-installed.
- **Upgrade Codeunit**: A codeunit that handles data transformations and upgrades when transitioning between different versions of an extension.

>[!info] Writing Install Code
- Install code is essential for setting up initial conditions, such as populating database tables or performing version checks. This code runs during the first installation or any subsequent re-installation of an extension.

>[!bug] Challenges in Upgrade Management
- Managing data consistency and application functionality across extension versions requires careful planning and execution of upgrade code.

>[!info] Key Installation Operations
- **OnInstallAppPerCompany()**: Handles company-specific installation logic.
- **OnInstallAppPerDatabase()**: Manages database-wide operations during installation.

>[!tip] Structuring Install Codeunits
- Use multiple install codeunits if necessary, but ensure they operate independently to avoid execution order issues.

>[!attention] Upgrade Code Execution
- Upgrade codeunits are crucial for maintaining data integrity and compatibility with new extension versions. They must handle data migrations, field additions, and other schema changes.

>[!example] Basic Install Codeunit Example
```al
codeunit 50100 MyInstallCodeunit
{
    Subtype=Install;

    trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    begin
        // Company-specific initialization code
    end;

    trigger OnInstallAppPerDatabase()
    begin
        // Database-wide initialization code
    end;
}
```

>[!info] Handling Data During Upgrades
- Upgrade codeunits should use triggers like **OnUpgradePerCompany()** and **OnUpgradePerDatabase()** to modify and verify data at both company and database levels during an upgrade.

>[!info] Upgrade Process Overview
- The upgrade process involves several key steps, including checking preconditions, executing upgrades, and validating the outcomes to ensure a successful update.

```al
codeunit 50100 MyUpgradeCodeunit
{
    Subtype=Upgrade;

    trigger OnCheckPreconditionsPerCompany()
    begin
        // Preconditions check code
    end;

    trigger OnUpgradePerCompany()
    begin
        // Company-specific upgrade code
    end;

    trigger OnValidateUpgradePerCompany()
    begin
        // Validation code post-upgrade
    end;
}
```

>[!info] Control Upgrade Execution
- Utilize version data and upgrade tags to manage when and how upgrade code is executed to prevent rerunning code unnecessarily and ensure efficient upgrades.
