1. **Service Update**: Your app moves forward with Business Central updates without requiring changes.
2. **App Update**: You enhance the app, which after re-validation, becomes available for new or reinstalling tenants.
3. **Bug Fixes**: Non-critical bugs are fixed and updated versions are submitted, but not automatically updated across all tenants.
4. **Critical Bug**: Urgent fixes are deployed automatically to all tenants post-validation to mitigate significant disruptions.
5. **Microsoft Feature Update**: Potential breaking changes from Microsoft are managed with prior notification and coordination to ensure your app remains compatible.

1. **Developer Initiates Update**: Add features or bug fixes and submit for validation.
2. **Validation and Release**: Once validated, the update is available for new installations and manual updates by existing users.
3. **Forced Updates**: During major releases or in the event of critical fixes, Microsoft may force updates to ensure continuity and security.
