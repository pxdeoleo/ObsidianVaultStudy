>Optimizing data transfer during upgrades in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central can significantly enhance performance. The DataTransfer AL data type facilitates set-based data operations, contrasting with the traditional row-by-row approach, offering substantial efficiency improvements.

#### Introduction to DataTransfer
- **DataTransfer**: An AL data type that allows bulk data transfer between SQL tables, optimizing performance during upgrades by leveraging SQL's set-based capabilities.

>[!info] Traditional vs. Set-Based Data Operations
- Traditional methods, such as using the record API, handle data row by row, which can be inefficient for large data volumes.
- The DataTransfer method employs set-based operations, generating SQL code that handles bulk data transfers, thus minimizing the number of database operations required.

>[!example] Traditional Record API Method
```al
local procedure CopyRows()
var
  from: Record FromTable;
  to: Record ToTable;
begin
  if from.Find() then
    repeat
      to.SmallCodeField := from.SmallCodeField;
      to.IntField := from.IntField;
      to.id := from.id;
      to.Insert();
    until from.Next() = 0;
end;
```

>[!tip] Set-Based DataTransfer Method
```al
local procedure CopyRows()
var
  dt: DataTransfer;
  to: Record ToTable;
begin
  dt.SetTables(Database::FromTable, Database::ToTable);
  dt.AddFieldValue(2, to.FieldNo("SmallCodeField"));
  dt.AddFieldValue(3, to.FieldNo("IntField"));
  dt.AddFieldValue(1, to.FieldNo("id"));
  dt.CopyRows();
end;
```

#### Key Features of DataTransfer
- **Bulk Operations**: Allows copying of data from one table to another in bulk, either by field or by entire rows.
- **Performance**: Significantly faster than traditional methods, particularly beneficial in environments with high latency or large data sets.

>[!attention] Usage Constraints
- DataTransfer is intended for use exclusively in upgrade codeunits and will trigger a runtime error if used elsewhere.
- It cannot be used with non-SQL tables, system tables, virtual tables, audited tables, or tables marked as obsolete.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Using DataTransfer
1. **Set Tables**: Define the source and destination tables.
2. **Add Field Values**: Map fields from the source to the destination or set constant values for certain fields.
3. **Add Joins**: Define relationships between tables if copying field values.
4. **Add Filters**: Apply filters to limit the data transferred.
5. **Execute Transfer**: Use `CopyFields` or `CopyRows` to perform the data transfer.

>[!warning] Event Triggers and DataTransfer
- DataTransfer operations do not trigger row-based events such as `OnBeforeModify` or `OnAfterInsert`, as they are set-based and not row-based operations.

#### Examples and Performance Insights
- **CopyFields Example**: Demonstrates copying specific field data from one table to another using a join condition.
- **CopyRows Example**: Illustrates how to insert new rows into a destination table based on conditions applied to the source table's data.

>[!note] Developer Tips
- Always ensure that join conditions produce a unique set of rows to avoid runtime errors due to non-unique relationships.
- Consider using DataTransfer for complex data migrations during app upgrades to improve performance and reduce the risk of errors.
